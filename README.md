# Text-Scanner

This is my first Rust applications so it's probably not the most efficient just yet.

To use create a txt file and save in the same folder as this application, simply run cargo run follwed by the word you want to find and the name of the file for example - Cargo run Hi test.txt (This will search test.txt for the word Hi)

I may in future change this to allow for user input instead of having to manually add the file in the cli commands.
